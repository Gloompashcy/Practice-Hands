# Practice Hands
A Balatro mod that adds various new hand types, they typically use base game jokers or enhancements

This mod requires the [latest steamodded alpha version](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded)

# Current Progress
Currently, 3 out of 6-7 planned hands and 4 out of 6-7 planned planets are implemented.

# Added Hands
## Mingles
These hands use wild cards to act as a fifth suit.
A mingle is played by playing 5 cards, with one card from each suit and one extra wild card.
They can be combined with a five of a kind or straight to create a different hand.
These are currently the only hands fully implemented.

## Flush Four
This hand can only be played when you have to "Four Fingers" joker.
It is not completely implemented, though its planet is.

## More Hands to be Added in the Future
